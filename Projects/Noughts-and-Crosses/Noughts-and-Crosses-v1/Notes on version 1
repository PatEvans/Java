-Text based noughts and crosses game
-Allows cartesian like coordinates to be input for each turn
-Algorithm used to check if a win or draw has occurred
-Error checking used to ensure that a piece can not be overwritten on the board. 
-I.e if a cross is in square 1,1 , noughts choosng 1,1 would give an error
-Winner determined and scoreboard shown after each win or draw

-A gui should be implemented in next version
