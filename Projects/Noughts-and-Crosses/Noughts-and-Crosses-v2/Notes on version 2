-All features are retained from previous version
-New version has a gui implemented using java swing
-2DGraphics used to draw a board on the JPanel
-This board changes colour based on which player's turn it is
-As with previous version an input of cartesian like coordinates is used to determine where on the board a piece will go. 
 In this case, a dropdown menu used. 
-A dropdown menu removes the need for range or data type validation - this is removed in this version
-Reset button added
-Scoreboard can be seen during play in this version - in previous version players had to wait until the end of the game

-Improvements for next version: rather than coordinate based input - user should be able to click on each square
