-New algorithm made to add support for any number of numbers in an input while previous version only supported 2
-E.g. now can do 12+12+12+12+12 while last version could only do 12+12
-Simplified code
-Each input must only use a single type of arithmetic operator e.g. +,-,/,*

-Needs order of operations algorithm to allow mixing of opperators.
